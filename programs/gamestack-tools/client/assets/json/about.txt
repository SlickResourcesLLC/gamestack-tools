-About json file storage (this folder):

When 'GameMaker' is running, it will refer to a list of memory resources in this folder.

Each resource will appear on the object lists of client/main.html (default start page)

'GameMaker' keeps enough info for each object to 'open' the object into the editor

*Editor can then modify and 'save' the file as a standard 'GameResource'

--Comparable to a lightweight-cms for 2D-game objects
