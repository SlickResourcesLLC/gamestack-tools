Gamestack is a powerful solution for rapid game development with javascript and html5.

# How to build a Sprite with complex behavior!

  - Gamestack.js has a Sprite() object that features complex properties and behavior
  - Use the Sprite() object on an html/javascript example


Gamestack Sprites are more than just one animation. They may include:
  - Animations (a list of 'switchable' animations)
  - Motions (any number of planned Motion())
  - Sounds
  - Projectiles (as in a Sprite() that 'throws an Animated Magic Spell)'
